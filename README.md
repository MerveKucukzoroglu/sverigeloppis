# UI
## Color Palette:
![Color palatte](media/loppis-color-palatte.png)
* Color palette is chosen with keeping in mind the target audience. As Sverige Loppis' main target is Sweden, Blue and Yellow was my first choice.
* Blue color has a psychological effect on trust, offical, calm; and yellow color psychologically gives a charming, friendly effect.
* To maintain the color contrast I chose to use a softer tones of blue and yellow. 
* I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate my color palette.

## Fonts
* To maintain simple UI, font chosen was Montserrat from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mont#standard-styles).

# Credits
During the process of project development, there have been various sources that gave me idea how to do a particular feature or fix a bug. The following are the sources that I got knowledge from:

* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* [Django Allauth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)
* [Django Project Documentation](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Code Instiute](https://codeinstitute.net/se/full-stack-software-development-diploma/?utm_term=code%20institute&utm_campaign=CI+-+SWE+-+Search+-+Brand&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=8983321581&hsa_cam=14660337051&hsa_grp=134087657984&hsa_ad=581817633089&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-319867646331&hsa_kw=code%20institute&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjw0PWRBhDKARIsAPKHFGgmnuTJCpzeJBqKg9fy2p-7NlU8NY95XaXmoPzBpuDdIekQWqUKxocaAso5EALw_wcB) course materials and Django Boutique Ado Walkthrough Project.
* [Bootstrap Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/)
* [Bootstrap Modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/modal/#tooltips-and-popovers)
* [Crispy Forms](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [AmIResponsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) for mockup of the site.

## Color Palette:
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to generate my color palette.
## Images:

    * [Home page background image](https://www.freepik.com/vectors/flea-market) Flea market vector created by [freepik](www.freepik.com)

## Styles:
* [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples): Box shadow in loppis details page is from [CSS Scan](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) example number 3.

## Codes:
* Grepper: “check if date < today in django template” functionality logic is by [Grepper](https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/python/check+if+date+%3C+today+in+django+template).
    ```python
        {% now "Y-m-d" as todays_date %}
        {% if todays_date < someday|date:"Y-m-d" %}
            <h1>It's not too late!</h1>
        {% endif %}
    ```
* Condition date widget: 'Ensure start/end dates are not before "today", and end-date comes on/after start-date'. This logic is by Tim Nelson, mentor in Code Institute.
    ```javascript
        let now = new Date(),
        minDate = now.toISOString().substring(0,10);
        $("#id_start_date").prop("min", minDate);
        $("#id_start_date").on("change", setEndDateMin);
        $("#id_end_date").on("change", setEndDateMin);
        function setEndDateMin() {
            let startDate = $("#id_start_date").val();
            $("#id_end_date").prop("min", startDate);
        }
    ```
* Followed Code Institute's [Boutique Ado walkthrough project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1/tree/250e2c2b8e43cccb56b4721cd8a8bd4de6686546) steps to add stripe and adjusted according to my sites needs.
